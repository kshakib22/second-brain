A tree is a nonlinear data structure with hierarchical relationships between its elements without having any cycle, it is basically a real life tree *flipped upside down*. No cycle means one node cannot have two references to it.

* **Hierarchical Structure:** Trees organize data in a parent-child relationship, forming a hierarchy.
* **Nodes:** Each element in a tree is called a node.
* **Root Node:** The topmost node is the root, with no parent.
* **Child Nodes:** Nodes connected below another node are its children. A node can have zero or more children.
* **Leaf Nodes:** Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes

#### **Types of Trees:**

* [**Binary Tree**](Binary%20Tree.md) : Each node has at most two children (left and right).
* **[[Binary Search Tree]] (BST):** A special kind of binary tree where the value of each node is greater than all its left children and less than all its right children. This allows for efficient searching.

## **Applications**

* **File Systems:** Organize files and directories in a hierarchical structure on your computer.
* **Search Algorithms:** Binary search trees enable efficient searching of sorted data.
* **Parse Trees:** Represent the structure of expressions or programs in computer science.
* **Decision Trees:** Used in machine learning to make predictions based on a series of questions.
* **Social Networks:** Represent relationships between people (friends, followers, etc.).
* **Routing Protocols:** Used in computer networks to determine the best path for data packets.

## **Pros/Cons**

**Advantages of Trees:**

* **Hierarchical Representation:** Efficiently model hierarchical relationships between data items.
* **Searching:** Binary Search Trees allow for fast searching of sorted data.
* **Dynamic Structure:** Trees can grow and shrink as data is added or removed.

**Disadvantages of Trees:**

* **Complexity for Some Operations:** Inserting or deleting elements in certain tree structures can be complex.
* **Memory Usage:** Storing unused space in the tree can be inefficient compared to arrays for simple data.
