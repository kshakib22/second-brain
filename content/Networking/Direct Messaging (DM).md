**Definition** : a way to start a connection with someone where the main priority is to get information. 

NOT a referral, NOT a job, but info on these. Initial steps are quite monotonous and *robotic* but that part is required to eliminate who will not help you. But do start with [Targeted Messaging](Targeted%20Messaging.md) to make sure it's not completely random.

## What to talk about?

Because this is a job search, talk about a certain position/job. But a lot less than you'd think, lot less about yourself. 
> Make it *at least* ***50%*** about them.

Emulate a real life conversation all under the umbrella of the **company**- 
- their interests
- asking about their experience in the role
- my background

## Structure

1. [[Intro Notes]]
2. Show interest in them + express gratitude
3. Ask questions (continuity)

Once basics are understood, move on to [[Templates for Networking]] to expedite the process.
