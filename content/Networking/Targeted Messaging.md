Who to DM?

Mainly the people in your role, or very similar role to begin with. The idea of contacting only the recruiters/hiring managers is a bit flawed because remember our [[Explanations/P1]] is to get information. Also getting exposure is important as well ([P2](Explanations/P2.md)). 

### Hierarchy

Connections can introduce you to other people or just point you to hiring managers. 
1. 1st connection $\leftrightarrow$ 2nd/3rd connection
	 - If they can point out to people that are hiring
2. Hiring managers directly
