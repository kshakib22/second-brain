This is my personal knowledge base, built on the principles of networked thinking. Dive into the interconnected web of ideas. There is no structure at the moment for this [[vault]]. I will add documentation to the installation process for my own record in case a newer version is released and I have to re-install or make changes again. The first sort of test-introductory page I created is the [Introduction](Introduction.md). It checks out different visual aspects such as text, code snippet, [[LaTeX]] code and placeholder text. I'm considering having a note containing [[Lorem Ipsum]]. Later on, I'll be creating a [[dashboard]] and some sort of [[dataview]] index. Here are some of the things I'll be working on:
1. [[Markdown cheat sheet ]]
2. Notes on web dev/ DSA 
3. [README](README.md)
4. Edit links to Github and Discord
