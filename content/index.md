This is my personal knowledge base, built on the principles of networked thinking. Working towards creating a 'knowledge hub' where ideas should interweave and spark new insights.

## Navigating Notes

- [JavaScript](Programming/Web%20Dev/JS/0%20-%20JavaScript.md)

The first sort of test-introductory page I created is the [Test](Others/Test.md). It checks out different visual aspects such as text, code snippet, [Latex](../docs/features/Latex.md) code and placeholder text. Later on, I'll be creating a [[dashboard]] and some sort of [[dataview]] index. Here are some of the things I'll be working on/fixing:
1. [Markdown cheat sheet](Others/Markdown%20cheat%20sheet.md) (pdf not working right. now)
2. Notes on DSA 
3. [README](../README.md) 
4. Edit links to Github and Discord
5.  Date stuff (modified/git/frontmatter)
6.  Add doc for Obsidian changes/plugins
7. Change heading font to SF mono (or body font)
