This is my personal knowledge base, built on the principles of networked thinking. Working towards creating a 'knowledge hub' where ideas should interweave and spark new insights.

## Navigating Notes

- [JavaScript](Programming/Web%20Dev/JS/0%20-%20JavaScript.md)
- [Markdown cheat sheet](Others/Markdown%20cheat%20sheet.md)

The first sort of test-introductory page I created is the [Test](Others/Test.md). It checks out different visual aspects such as text, code snippet, LaTeX code and placeholder text. Later on, I'll be creating a [[dashboard]] and some sort of [[dataview]] index. Here are some of the things I'll be working on/fixing:

- [ ] Import Notes on DSA 
- [ ] Import leetcode notes
- [ ] [README](../README.md) 
- [ ] Complete doc for Obsidian changes/plugins
- [ ] Analytics
- [x] Test out the importer from apple notes with drawing from iPad
- [ ] Quotes/Knowledge/Blog system instead of daily notes
- [x] Excalidraw integration with ipad
