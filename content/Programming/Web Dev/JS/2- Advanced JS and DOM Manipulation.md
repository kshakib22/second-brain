In JavaScript, [[addEventListener]] is a powerful method that allows you to attach **event listeners** to HTML elements. It essentially creates a watch on a specific element, waiting for a particular event (like a click) to occur. When the event happens, the provided *function* (called the event handler) is executed, enabling you to perform actions in response to user interaction.

Using  `addEventListener` we can attach this listener to an element. When attached, we can use [anonymous functions](anonymous%20functions.md) along with [this](this) keyword to make changes to that element directly.  If a specific function is passed to `addEventListener`, then it becomes a [Higher-Order Function](Higher-Order%20Functions.md).

Check [[OOP in JavaScript]] for objects/constructors etc. Everything in JS is basically flexible, mutable objects and both properties and methods for an object can be added at anytime. It is essentially [Prototype based](Prototype%20based) language, which has a number of significant differences compared to traditional OOP.
