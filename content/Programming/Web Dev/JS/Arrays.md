Arrays are similar to Python lists in terms of declaration.
```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; 
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```
Arrays are quite different from Python in terms of the names of their available methods. There are around 20 methods for arrays, however add them below one-by-one as you learn them. As usual, the methods are accessed using dot operator as such `arr.push(5)`

1. `push` - adds an element at the end of the array (append)
2. `pop` - removes the last element

 
 `Array.length` - is a **property** that returns the size of array. No brackets.
