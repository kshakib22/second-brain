Higher-order functions are functions that either take other functions as **arguments** or *return* functions as their **result**.

**Why Use Higher-Order Functions?**
- Code reusability and abstraction.
- More concise and readable code.
- They facilitate functional programming techniques.

Higher order function has one or more parameters as a function. In the example below, `calculate` is the HOF which has function `operation` as parameter. 

```js
// Higher-order function that takes two numbers and a function
function calculate(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b);
}

// Example functions to use with applyOperation
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

// Using the higher-order function
const sum = calculate(5, 3, add); // sum is 8
const product = calculate(5, 3, multiply); // product is 15

console.log(sum); // Output: 8
console.log(product); // Output: 15

```
