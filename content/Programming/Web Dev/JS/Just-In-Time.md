Modern JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox) use JIT compilation. The code is initially translated into an intermediate format (like bytecode). Then, during runtime, frequently executed parts of the code are compiled into machine code for faster performance. This approach offers a balance between the flexibility of interpretation and the speed of compiled languages.
