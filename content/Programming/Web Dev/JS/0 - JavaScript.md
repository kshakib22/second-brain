## Working within a browser

For chrome, use developer tools `->` sources. Then within submenu select Snippets. It will show `index.js `  on the left where we can add js scripts to see how it affects browser behavior. Then press `âŒ˜+Enter` to run.

## Basics

The notes don't go into too much details considering some existing programming knowledge. Maybe at different points it will be compared to existing knowledge (mainly [[Python]]).

Here is the basic data types. Things get intense when we see all the different objects represented by these types.
- [[String]]
- [[Number]] - technically int and float considered same type here
- [[Boolean]] - true or false
- [[Undefined]] - value not assigned yet
- [[Null]] - absence of value altogether

[[alert]] (message) -  brings up a pop up with the message
[[prompt]] (message) - brings up a pop up with message that can take an input 
[[var]] - is a keyword used to [[declare]] *variables* 

Both `i++` as well as `i+=` is allowed in Javascript. 

## Compilation

JS is neither [[interpreted]] nor [[compiled]] but uses a mix of both known as just-in-time ([[Just-In-Time]]) compiled language.
