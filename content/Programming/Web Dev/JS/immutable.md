Immutable data structures cannot be modified after they are created. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. **[[String]]**
2. **[[Number]]**
3. **[[Boolean]]**
4. **[[Symbol]]**
5. **[[Frozen Objects]]**


Although individual elements cannot be changed, the variable however, can be re-assigned. Don't get confused with `const` as explained in [declare](declare.md).
