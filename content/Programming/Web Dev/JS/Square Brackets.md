`[]` are *VERY*  underpowered in JS compared to Python. Here are some major differences/uses:

- You can use square brackets `[ ]` to access elements, but only in one direction from start to end.
- Basically used to get individual characters. 
- For [[mutable]] structures, you can change elements like `arr[2] = "two"`
- You **cannot** slice using `[ ]` methods.
- You **cannot** get last element using `[-1]`
