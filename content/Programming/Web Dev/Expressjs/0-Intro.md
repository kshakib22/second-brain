**Express.js** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building *server-side* applications using Node.js. This means handles requests from the client, processes data, and sends responses back.

- **Simplicity:** It provides a streamlined way to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Routing:** It helps define different routes for your application, like different pages or API endpoints.
- **Middleware:** It allows you to add custom functions (middleware) to process requests and responses.

When we start an Express.js server, it listens on a specified port for incoming HTTP requests. The server is usually run on [localhost](../localhost) during development to test the application. Look into [HTTP requests](../HTTP%20requests.md) to learn about the basic requests a server deals with.
