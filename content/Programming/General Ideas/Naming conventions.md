**1. Camel Case:**

- **Appearance:** Words are joined together with the first letter of each word capitalized (except the first word, which is lowercase).
- **Example:** `myVariableName`, `calculateArea`, `htmlDocument`
- **Use Cases:** Often used for variable names, function names, and method names in JavaScript. Can also be used for class names, although some style guides prefer PascalCase for classes (especially in JavaScript with ES6 classes).

**2. Snake Case:**

- **Appearance:** Words are joined together with underscores (`_`) between them, all lowercase.
- **Example:** `my_variable_name`, `calculate_area`, `html_document`
- **Use Cases:** The most common convention in Python for variable names, function names, and method names. Can also be used for class names.

**3. Pascal Case:**

- **Appearance:** Similar to camel case, but the first letter of **every** word is capitalized.
- **Example:** `MyVariableName`, `CalculateArea`, `HtmlDocument`
- **Use Cases:** Traditionally used for class names in both Python and JavaScript (although camelCase is gaining popularity for classes in JavaScript).
