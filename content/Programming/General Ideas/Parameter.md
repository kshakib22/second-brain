# Parameter 

A parameter is a *placeholder* for variables that is taken as input for functions. The name is placeholder as well, which will be used inside the function to do stuff. Depending on the language used, it will also contain the type of the variable. They are local to function, and only exist within that scope.

Compare to [[Argument]] as they are closely related.

```python
def greet(name):  # "name" is the parameter
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Here, "Alice" is the argument passed to the function
greet("Alice")

```
