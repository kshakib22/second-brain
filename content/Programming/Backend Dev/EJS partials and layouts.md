EJS Partials allow developers to reuse common sections of HTML code across multiple views, making the codebase more maintainable and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). They are typically used for sections like headers, footers, navigation bars, or any other part of the HTML that repeats across multiple pages.

- Partials are created as separate EJS files, typically stored in a partials directory.
- They are included in other EJS files using the <%- include('path_to_partial') %> syntax.

Example Structure:
- /views
	- /partials
	- header.ejs
	- footer.ejs

Suppose our header and footer are as follows: 

```html
<!-- header.ejs -->
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
    <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

```html
<!-- footer.ejs -->
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
</footer>
```

Then we can include in our main ejs file `index.ejs` using templating as such -

```html
<!-- index.ejs -->
<%- include('partials/header') %>
<main>
  <h2>Welcome to the Home Page</h2>
  <p>This is the main content area.</p>
</main>
<%- include('partials/footer') %>
```
