Middleware in web development refers to software that acts as a **bridge** between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. It is a key part of backend development, handling various tasks between the client and the server.

- **Request and Response Handling**: Middleware functions typically handle HTTP requests and responses, processing them *before* they reach the serverâ€™s core logic or before the responses are sent back to the client.
- **Pre-Processing**: Middleware can perform operations such as logging, authentication, and session management, transforming the request object before it reaches the main application logic.
- **Post-Processing**: Middleware can also modify the response object before sending it back to the client, for example, formatting data, adding headers, or compressing responses.
- **Authentication**

A commmon example of this is [[body-parser]] used in Node for pre-processing. Another used for logging is the [[morgan]] middleware.
