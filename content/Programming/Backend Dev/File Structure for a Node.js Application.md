A typical Node.js application has a well-organized directory structure that separates different parts of the application.

## Root Directory
- **package.json**: This file contains metadata about the project, such as dependencies, scripts, and configuration. It is essential for managing the project's dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json**: This file is automatically generated and ensures that the exact version of dependencies is installed.
- **README.md**: A markdown file that usually contains information about the project, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Directories
- **node_modules**: This directory contains all the installed dependencies and modules. It is automatically created and managed by npm (Node Package Manager) when you run `npm install`. *These should not be manually edited*.
- **public**: This directory is used to serve static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets directly to the client. It is often configured in the web server setup (e.g., using Express).
- **src** or **lib**: This directory contains the main source code of the application. It typically includes the core business logic, controllers, models, routes, and other application-specific files.
