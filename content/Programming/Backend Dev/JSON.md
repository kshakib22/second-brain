JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and a client in web applications.

### Structure of JSON

JSON is built on two structures:

1. **Object**: An unordered collection of key/value pairs.
    - Keys are strings.
    - Values can be strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, null, or other objects.
      ```json
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25,
        "isStudent": false,
        "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
        "address": {
          "city": "New York",
          "zipCode": 10001
        }
      }
      ```

2. **Array**: An ordered list of values.
    - Values can be any of the types mentioned above.
      ```json
      [
        "JavaScript",
        "Python",
        "C++"
      ]
      ```

### Acessing data from JSON

When working with JSON data in JavaScript, you can access specific objects or properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

Suppose we have the following object:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alice",
    "contact": {
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "phone": "123-456-7890"
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Dot Notation**: Use dot notation to access nested objects or properties.

```js
const userName = jsonData.user.name; // "Alice"
const userEmail = jsonData.user.contact.email; // "alice@example.com"
```

2. **Bracket Notation**: Use bracket notation, especially when dealing with dynamic keys or keys that contain special characters (because strings can be manipulated).

```js
const userPhone = jsonData["user"]["contact"]["phone"]; // "123-456-7890"
```


### JSON and APIs

- JSON is widely used in APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to format and transmit data between clients and servers.
- APIs often send JSON data in response to requests, and clients parse this data to use it in applications.
- When a client requests data from a server, the server responds with JSON data.
- The client can then manipulate this JSON data as needed, such as rendering it on a webpage or storing it in a database.

### Similarities with JavaScript Objects

JSON's syntax is a subset of the syntax for JavaScript objects. This similarity allows JavaScript to easily convert JSON strings into objects and vice versa.

```javascript
// JavaScript Object
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: false
};

// JSON String
const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":25,"isStudent":false}';
```

**Parsing and Stringifying**:
  - `JSON.parse()`: Converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object.
  - `JSON.stringify()`: Converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
  
    ```javascript
    const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":25,"isStudent":false}';
    const jsObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);

    const newJsonString = JSON.stringify(jsObject);
    ```

### Key Differences

**Keys as Strings**: 
  - In JSON, all keys must be strings, enclosed in double quotes (`"`).
  - In JavaScript objects, keys can be strings, numbers, or symbols, and quotes are not always required.

**Data Types**: 
  - JSON supports a limited set of data types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null.
  - JavaScript objects can contain functions, `undefined`, and other complex data types, which are not allowed in JSON.
