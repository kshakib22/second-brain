In Express.js, the `(req, res)` pattern is fundamental for handling HTTP requests and sending responses.
- `req` (Request): This object represents the HTTP request and contains all the information about the request, such as parameters, query strings, body data, HTTP headers, and more.
- `res` (Response): This object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
