Depending on the type of application, the backend might use different types of authentication. They differ mainly in terms of the security they provide, beside other factors. Understanding how to implement these in Axios allows developers to interact with APIs and services while safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized entities can access protected resources.

A general overview over why different methods of authentication are needed are as follows: 

**Security**:
- Each method addresses different security needs. For instance, while Basic Authentication might suffice for simple cases, OAuth2 is crucial for secure, large-scale, third-party integrations.
**Varying Access Control**:
- These methods help control who can access certain resources, ensuring that only authorized users or services can perform specific actions. Casual users with basic auth or even no auth will have limited actions available to them.
**Scalability**:
- Token-based methods like Bearer Tokens or OAuth2 provide better scalability for applications that need to manage many users and devices across different platforms.
**Compliance**:
-  Certain industries and applications must adhere to strict compliance standards, where robust authentication mechanisms are mandatory.
## Bearer Token Authentication

- A security token is passed along with the request, often in the `Authorization` header.
- The token typically grants access to specific resources or APIs.
- Commonly used in OAuth 2.0.
```javascript
axios.get('/protected-endpoint', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

## Basic Authentication

- Combines a username and password into a base64-encoded string and sends it in the `Authorization` header.
- It's a simple method but less secure without HTTPS, as credentials are encoded but not encrypted.

```javascript
axios.get('/protected-endpoint', {
  auth: {
	username: 'yourUsername',
	password: 'yourPassword'
  }
});
```

## API Key Authentication 

  - Uses a unique key provided by the server to identify and authenticate a client.
  - Typically sent in query parameters or headers.

```javascript
axios.get('/endpoint', {
  params: { apiKey: 'yourAPIKey' }
});
```

## OAuth2 Authentication

  - Often involves an authorization server providing an access token after a user authenticates.
  - The token is then used for subsequent requests.

```javascript
axios.get('/endpoint', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
});
```
