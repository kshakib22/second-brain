I decided to start things off randomly. This is a complete random on linkedin who shared a video. As the hardest part is starting, I thought why not just start from here and build up from there?

### Key Points on Networking on LinkedIn

1. **Proactive Outreach**
   - **Timestamp: 00:43**

2. **Creating a Networking Funnel**
   - **Timestamp: 01:23**

4. **Increasing Visibility**

5. **Volume of Outreach**
   - **Timestamp: 06:18**

9. **Use of Intro Notes**
   - **Timestamp: 11:14**
   - **Description:** When sending connection requests, include a brief intro note. This is like a friendly wave and can lead to further conversation once accepted.

10. **Continuing the Conversation**
    - **Timestamp: 13:07**
    - **Description:** Once someone responds, acknowledge their statement and ask a follow-up question. This keeps the conversation going and allows you to gather more information.

11. **Calendly Links**
    - **Timestamp: 17:55**
    - **Description:** Use tools like Calendly to easily schedule calls with people who are willing to help. This makes it convenient for both parties to set up a time to chat.

12. **Follow-Up Questions**
    - **Timestamp: 16:53**
    - **Description:** Be prepared with specific follow-up questions about the job role or company. This shows attentiveness and investment in the conversation.

13. **Personalized Messaging**

    - **Timestamp: 19:52**
    - **Description:** Don’t be discouraged by non-responses. Increase your outreach volume and refine your messages based on the responses you receive.

15. **Using Job Descriptions in Conversations**
    - **Timestamp: 19:52**
    - **Description:** Use the job description as a basis for your conversation. Ask specific questions about the role and connect your skills and experiences to the job requirements. This can naturally lead to a referral request.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively use LinkedIn to network, gather information, and increase your chances of securing a job in your desired field.
