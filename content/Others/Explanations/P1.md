These are the **must-do** items that deserve a gold star on your to-do list. As a concept, P1 is something you cannot forget while dealing with the bigger picture. If your P1 is to get a project done, understanding different aspects of the project already becomes [[P2]] . Because P1 is to GET IT DONE!
Understand later, make notes and move on. Tackling P1s first keeps them at the top of your project game and avoids any last-minute scrambles.


> [!Warning]  Multiple P1
> Deal with a **single** P1 at any given time. P1 should never be stacked unless in an emergency situation.
