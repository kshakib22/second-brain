**Definition** : a way to start a connection with someone where the main priority is to get information. 

NOT a referral, NOT a job, but info on these. Initial steps are quite monotonous and *robotic* but that part is required to eliminate who will not help you.

## What to talk about?

Because this is a job search, talk about a certain position/job. But a lot less than you'd think, lot less about yourself. 
> Make it *at least* ***50%*** about them.
