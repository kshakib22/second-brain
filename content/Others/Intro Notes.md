This varies highly depending on the type of connection. Let's generalize and approach this first.
## Note

If the person is not connected, send a *connection request* + *personalized note*.

**DON'Ts**
- don't ask for favor at this point
- no advertisement
- don't make it long

> [!Warning]  No Note Approach
> Stop applying for jobs if you're not sending notes for connection. It's hopeless for you.
