## Starting 

Feeling somewhat motivated today. Slowly working on the idea of accepting that I'll be in Bangladesh for a significant amount of time. Very slowly.

### Goals
- [x] Start local LLM process
- [ ] Some Web Dev
- [x] Basic Obsidian templating

### Mood
ðŸ™‚

## Ending

Joined Bhattu and Bhasin on discord after a while. Played Valorant after even longer. Not a bad way to end the day.
