# First Daily Note

I plan on creating a good template for daily notes. Current ideas are to include a recurring to-do as well as additional to-do for the specific day. Maybe a [[gratitude]] section like the general mass, who knows. For today the main focus would be getting back into studies. Firstly basic JavaScript and then possibly some DSA. I'm out of cigarettes as well, maybe that will be a good excuse for a walk outside.

Goals for today
- [x] Some JavaScript/Web Dev
- [ ] Some DSA
- [ ] Obsidian stuff during breaks
	- [ ] Fix date stuff
	- [ ] Look into font stuff
- [ ] [Giscus](../Tools/Giscus.md) as a [[Long Term Goals]]

## Final thoughts

I did get cigarettes and that tiny walk. Didn't get much done though.
