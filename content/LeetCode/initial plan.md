### Organizational Method for Notes

1. **Create a Folder Structure:**
    
    - **Leetcode DSA Problems**
        - **Arrays**
        - **Strings**
        - **Linked Lists**
        - **Trees**
        - **Graphs**
        - **Dynamic Programming**
        - **Sorting and Searching**
        - **Backtracking**
        - **Miscellaneous**
2. **Note-Taking Format:**
    
    - **Problem Title:**
    - **Problem Description:**
    - **Approach:**
        - Brute Force Approach
        - Optimized Approach
        - Code
        
    - **Complexity Analysis:**
        - Time Complexity
        - Space Complexity
    - **Edge Cases:**
    - **Personal Notes:**
        - Insights, mistakes, things to remember
2. **Tracking Solved Problems:**
    
    - Create a master note or a spreadsheet that lists all the problems you've solved.
    - Include columns for the problem title, link to the Leetcode problem, date solved, difficulty level, and a link to your detailed note on the problem.
3. **Linking Notes:**
    
    - Use the backlinking feature of Obsidian to link related notes. For instance, link a note on "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" to notes on other string problems.
    - OR use tags for strings etc - similar to leetcode site

By organizing your notes this way, you'll have a comprehensive and easily navigable record of your DSA problem-solving journey, which can be invaluable for interview preparation.
