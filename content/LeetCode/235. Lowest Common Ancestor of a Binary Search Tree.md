## Problem Statement

> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

**Example 1:**

> `Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8`    
> `Output: 6`
> `Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6`

**Example 2:**

> `Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4`    
> `Output: 2`  
> `Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.`

## Approach & Explanation


1.	Both nodes are in the left subtree.
2.	Both nodes are in the right subtree.
3.	One node is in the left subtree and the other is in the right subtree.
4.	One node is the LCA itself.

### Case 1: Both Nodes in the Left Subtree

For example, p = 2 and q = 4 in the tree.

### Case 2: Both nodes in the right subtree

For example, p = 17 and q = 20 in the tree.

### Case 3: One node is in left subtree other in the right

For example, p = 2 and q = 18 in the tree.

### Case 4: One node is the LCA itself

For example, p = 2 and q = 1 in the tree.
