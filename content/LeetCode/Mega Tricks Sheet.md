## BST, Trees

- Usually the iterative solution involves a use of a **stack**. Easy to remember, as stack simulates the *call stack* used in recursion.
- The breadth first solution almost always involves uses a **heap**
- A lot of recursive solution involves writing a helper function inside the main one that is called recursively.
