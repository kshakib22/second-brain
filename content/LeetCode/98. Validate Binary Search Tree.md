## Problem Statement

> Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

> `Input: root = [2,1,3]`    
> `Output: true `  

**Example 2:**

> `Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]`   
> `Output: `
